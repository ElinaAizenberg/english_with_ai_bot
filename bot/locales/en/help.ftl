help-message = <b>How to Start?</b>

                Your subscription starts the moment you press "Start."
                The <b>/start</b> command will give you a short description of what this bot can do.
                In order to activate your account and receive the first set of new vocabulary, you need to send the <b>/activate</b> command. Beforehand, you can check and change your settings with the <b>/account</b> command.
                <i>While your account is not activated, you won‚Äôt receive messages with new vocabulary.</i>

                <b>New Vocabulary Every Day</b>
                Every day at 9 o‚Äôclock (UTC time), you will receive 2 messages: a word and an idiom.
                Each message contains an explanation of meaning and an example. Also, each message has 2 buttons:
                - Link to the Cambridge dictionary page
                - Next

                You can click ‚ÄòNext‚Äô if you're already familiar with a word/idiom and want to get another one. You have <b>3 options per day</b> for both new words and idioms. In other words, you can click ‚ÄòNext‚Äô 2 times for each message.

                <b>Generate Images and Check Grammar</b>
                You can send your examples with new vocabulary to the bot by starting the message with the <b>/check</b> command. For example:
                <b>/check</b> A jury found unanimously that there was proof of her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

                An example should be a complete sentence that the bot will find coherent (not a random set of words) with new vocabulary used. Otherwise, it will ask you to provide another example.

                The bot will check the grammar, spelling, and return a corrected version if needed, as well as generate an image based on your example and the amount of earned points.
                You have <b>2 available checks per day</b>. In other words, you can generate 2 images per day.
                If you clicked the ‚ÄòNext‚Äô button, please use the latest provided item of new vocabulary.


                <b>Subscription</b>
                Every new user gets <b>7 days of a free trial period</b>. When it‚Äôs over, the user‚Äôs account is frozen. It can be reactivated with payment for further subscription or with one of the promo codes.

                <b>Account</b>
                You can check your account settings with the <b>/account</b> command (in the main menu):
                - Status
                - Level (A1,...,C2)
                - Topic
                - Language of the bot (Russian or English)

                Also, you can change these parameters with respective buttons under the message with the account summary.
                More information about levels in English is <a href="https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-levels/understand-your-english-level">here</a>.

                <b>Points</b>
                You can earn points by sending examples with new vocabulary to the bot. Don‚Äôt forget to start the message with the <b>/check</b> command.
                If you use one new word or idiom in the sentence, it gives you <b>1 point</b>; both word and idiom - <b>2 points</b>.
                If you send an example for checking without any new vocabulary, you will lose 1 point (if your balance is not zero).
                You can check how many points you have with the <b>/points</b> command (in the main menu).

                <b>Vocabulary</b>
                You can check all words and idioms saved for your account sending the command with the <b>/vocabulary</b> command.

                <b>Contact the Developer</b>
                If you have any problems or questions, the information in this message should be enough to find an answer. Nevertheless, if you don‚Äôt find relevant information here or wish to share feedback, you will find the developer‚Äôs contact information with the <b>/contact</b> command (in the main menu).
